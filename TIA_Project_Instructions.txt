Step-by-Step Guide: TIA Portal PLC Project Setup and Testing

1. Create New Project
- Open TIA Portal.
- Select "Create new project".
- Enter project name, e.g., "Quality_Inspector_Test".
- Click Finish.

2. Add Device
- Go to Project View → "Add new device".
- Select CPU (e.g., SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU 1214C).
- The CPU will be added to the project.

3. Ladder Logic (OB1)
- Open Program blocks → OB1.
- Switch to Ladder (LAD) editor.
- Implement the following logic:

Scenario: Conveyor + Sensor + Motor + Emergency Stop

Inputs/Outputs:
I0.0 = Start button
I0.1 = Stop button
I0.2 = Sensor (material detection)
I0.3 = Emergency Stop
Q0.0 = Motor output (conveyor)

Logic:
Start → Motor runs
Stop → Motor stops
Emergency Stop → Motor immediately stops
Sensor detects material → Motor stops

Ladder Logic:
Network 1: Motor Start/Stop
(I0.0 AND NOT I0.1 AND NOT I0.3 AND NOT I0.2) → Q0.0

4. Simulation (PLCSIM)
- Start Simulation (PLCSIM).
- Download program to simulated CPU.
- Switch CPU to RUN mode.

5. Testing
- Force I0.0 = 1 → Motor Q0.0 turns ON.
- Force I0.1 = 1 → Motor Q0.0 turns OFF.
- Force I0.3 = 1 → Motor Q0.0 turns OFF immediately.
- Force I0.2 = 1 → Motor Q0.0 turns OFF (material detected).

6. Screen Recording
- Windows: Win + G → Xbox Game Bar → Record.
- Or use OBS Studio for screen + voice recording.
